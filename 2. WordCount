# Using the Python language, have the function WordCount(str) take the str string parameter being passed 
# and return the number of words the string contains (ie. "Never eat shredded wheat" would return 4). Words will be separated by single spaces. 

Method 1:
count=0

def WordCount(str):
    global count
    for i in str.split():
        count=count+1
    return count
    
WordCount("Never eat shredded wheat") 


Method 2:
str =  "Never eat shredded wheat"
list1 = str.split()
len(list1)

Notes:
Use len(): For most cases, to get the number of elements in a list.

Use a for loop: If you need to manually count elements, though it's less efficient.

Use Counter: To count occurrences of each element in the list.

Use sum() with a generator: For conditional counting.

Use length_hint(): For estimating the length of iterators, not standard lists.
